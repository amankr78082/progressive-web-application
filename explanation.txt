Explanation:
index.html: The main page of the application, where the Service Worker is registered.

manifest.json: Contains metadata about the app, making it installable as a PWA.

service-worker.js: Manages caching to allow offline functionality.

To test this PWA:

Place all the files in a web server (like a localhost server).

Open the app in a browser that supports PWAs (like Chrome or Edge).

Test the offline capabilities by disconnecting from the internet.
