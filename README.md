A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a type of web application that combines the best features of traditional websites and native apps. Here's a detailed overview:

### Key Features of PWAs:
1. **Installable**: PWAs can be added to a device's home screen, making them accessible like native apps.
2. **Offline Functionality**: They use service workers to cache resources, enabling offline access.
3. **Responsive Design**: PWAs adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
4. **Fast Loading**: They prioritize performance, ensuring quick load times even on slow networks.
5. **Push Notifications**: PWAs can send notifications to engage users, similar to native apps.
6. **Secure**: They are served over HTTPS, ensuring data integrity and security.
7. **Cross-Platform**: A single codebase works across multiple platforms and devices.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web technologies for building the app.
- **Service Workers**: Scripts that run in the background to handle caching and offline functionality.
- **Web App Manifest**: A JSON file that defines the app's metadata, like its name, icons, and start URL.
- **Application Shell Architecture**: Ensures fast loading by caching the app's shell.

### Benefits of PWAs:
- Cost-effective development compared to native apps.
- No need for app store distribution; they can be accessed via a URL.
- Improved user engagement and retention due to offline capabilities and notifications.

### Examples of PWAs:
- Twitter Lite
- Pinterest
- Starbucks
